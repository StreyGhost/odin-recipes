    <h1> Steak and Gnocchi</h1>

    <h2>Recipe from Blue Apron</h2>
    
    <ol>

        <li> <strong>Step 1</strong> <br>
            Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high. Add gnocchi and cook, undisturbed, until they begin to float, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer gnocchi to a medium heatproof bowl. Add beans to boiling water; cook for 1 minute. Transfer to bowl with gnocchi. Reserve ½ cup cooking water.
        </li> 
        <li> <strong>Step 2</strong>
            Season steak with ½ teaspoon each salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Add steak and cook, flipping once, until deeply browned on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side for medium-rare. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong>
            Reduce heat under skillet to medium. Add butter and let melt. Add shallot and cook, stirring, until softened, about 1 minute. Add gnocchi, beans, and reserved cooking water; bring to a simmer and cook, undisturbed, until liquid is reduced and saucy, about 2 minutes. Stir in parsley, capers, and remaining ½ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper.
        </li> 
        <li><strong>Step 4</strong>
            Slice steak and serve with gnocchi and beans.
